# Xuan Jiang's Project Portfolio  

### 2025 – **R Shiny Project: Pooled Testing for Infectious Diseases**  
[App Link](https://xuan-jiang.shinyapps.io/PooledTesting/)  
- **Language/Tools**: R, Shiny, ggplot2  
- **Description**: Developed an interactive app to simulate and visualize pooled testing strategies for infectious diseases. Users can adjust parameters (infection prevalence, pool size) to evaluate cost-effectiveness and efficiency.  
- **Key Findings**: Demonstrated significant test savings at low prevalence rates with minimal loss of detection accuracy.  
- **Type**: Individual project

### 2025 – **R Project: Comparative Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) of HPV Vaccines**  
- **Language/Tools**: R, survival analysis, decision modeling  
- **Description**: Built Markov-based cohort and microsimulation models comparing HPV vaccines (Gardasil 9 vs. Cervarix). Incorporated utilities, transition probabilities, and discounted QALYs.  
- **Key Findings**: Gardasil 9 showed higher upfront cost but improved long-term QALY gains, yielding favorable ICERs under common willingness-to-pay thresholds.  
- **Type**: Individual project

### 2024 – **Python Project: Unlocking Potential – Modeling Transferability and Future Performance of D1 Athletes** *(Group Project)*  
- **Language/Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, BeautifulSoup (web scraping)  
- **Description**: Collected NCAA Division 1 athlete data through web scraping and built a pipeline to preprocess, clean, and structure heterogeneous records. Defined a custom similarity function to measure athlete comparability across teams and seasons. Applied supervised and unsupervised learning models to predict transferability and future performance.  
- **Key Findings**: Web scraping enabled a richer dataset with career and performance histories. Our similarity function improved clustering quality, while random forest and regularized regression identified training history, position, and playtime as key predictors of future success.  
- **Type**: Group project

### 2024 – **Python Project: Predictive Insights – Consumer Finance Claims Analysis**  
- **Language/Tools**: Python, NumPy, scikit-learn, SQL  
- **Description**: Built predictive models to explore claim behaviors in consumer finance datasets. Focused on risk segmentation and early warning for fraudulent or high-risk claims.  
- **Key Findings**: Gradient boosting and logistic regression achieved strong classification performance; identified behavioral patterns driving financial risk.  
- **Type**: Individual project

### 2023 – **Python Project: EigenWealth – Portfolio Optimization via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  
- **Language/Tools**: Python, NumPy, linear algebra, optimization libraries  
- **Description**: Used SVD to analyze financial time-series data, reduce dimensionality, and optimize asset allocations under risk-return trade-offs.  
- **Key Findings**: Achieved improved diversification strategies compared to traditional mean-variance optimization, with reduced exposure to correlated risks.  
- **Type**: Individual project
